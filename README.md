# [Working title]
## A Moonshot game for Game Off 2020

#### Concept
The game will be a 2d side-scrolling shooter with some Metroidvania and Roguelike aspects.

The Player's weapons will all involve effecting the enemies' gravity. Lorewise, the weapons are powered by moon rocks to fit the theme of `Moonshot`.
